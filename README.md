# AI Safety Incident Dashboard

## 🚀 Project Description

This project is a **Frontend Take-Home Assignment** for an AI Safety Startup (HumanChain).  
It is a **ReactJS** based interactive **AI Safety Incident Dashboard** that allows users to:

- **View** a list of AI safety incidents (with Title, Severity, and Reported Date).
- **Filter** incidents by Severity: High, Medium, Low.
- **Sort** incidents by Reported Date (Newest First / Oldest First).
- **Expand/Collapse** incident details with a "View Details" button.
- **Report New Incidents** using a form with validation.
- **Manage state locally** without any backend (all data is session-based).

The dashboard is styled with a clean, responsive design using modern layout techniques (Flexbox/Grid).

This project aligns with the mission of HumanChain: _"Building a safer, more trustworthy, and human-centric digital world through AI safety."_
